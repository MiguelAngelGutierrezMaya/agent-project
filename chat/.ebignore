# Elastic Beanstalk Ignore File
#
# Files and directories to exclude from the deployment package.
# Similar to .gitignore, but specifically for EB deployments.
#
# This helps reduce the deployment package size and prevents exposing
# unnecessary files to the production environment.
#
# IMPORTANT: We need src/, tsconfig*.json, and nest-cli.json for compilation!
